# Real Time Food Bank Data Base

## Felix, Liam & Samuel



**About us:**

We are a group of first year college students that are beginners at coding. We joined in the hopes of being able to finish a project, whether it was worthy of first place, or barely met the requirements. Throughout the project, we all learned some different coding languages and we were worked hard in order to finish our project in time.



**Our project works as follow: **

1. We extract the data from the given spreadsheet
2. We then utilized the Google API in order to get Latitude and Longitude Coordinates
3. The information is updated in real time in order to make sure it is in sync with the spreadsheet
4. We have a MySQL database setup in order to protect ourselves from any data leakage
5. We have an inventory update system in the admin page that can manage the item quantities and values.
6. All the back-end information is then transferred over to our website which displays the information into blocks



**How to enable the backend:**

The Heroku procfile will automatically launch the app.py
If you were to use another cloud provider, as long as it lauches app.py, everything should work fine
command line:  python app.py



**Problems we encountered**

We could not manage to finish our editor or out inventory display. The only part we have working cleanly is the food bank information page. It took us too much time to learn SQL queries, but we're glad all the required functions are present.
